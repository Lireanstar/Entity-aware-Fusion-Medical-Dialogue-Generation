### To add the code of the boost curriculum 5-fold, which is used for finetuning the EFMDG model. 
The experimental results show that the strategy we proposed is effective. Although we used the validation set for training, we found that for the generation task, fitting the validation set can better enhance the generalization performance of the model. This method can help generate models to fit difficult samples in course learning. In this way, we can further obtain better results than the original BerTGPT model.
